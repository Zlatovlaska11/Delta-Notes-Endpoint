##  Overview

The Delta-Notes-Endpoint project is an API server built using Rust and associated technologies such as Tide, Shuttle, and async libraries. Its core functionalities revolve around user authentication, file handling, and database management to serve PowerPoint presentations on demand based on user requests. This application allows users to login, register, and access their courses associated files while ensuring consistent testing for reliable file processing. Database interactions manage user registration and presentation data, enabling seamless communication between endpoints and the file handler component.

| [test.json](https://github.com/Zlatovlaska11/Delta-Notes-Endpoint/blob/master/test.json)       | The `test.json` file in the `Delta-Notes-Endpoint` repository serves as configuration data for testing various file handling scenarios in the application. It follows the JSON format and contains an array of test objects, each representing a single test case. The main purpose of this file is to facilitate consistent and automated testing of the file handler module in the context of the REST API (defined by `endpoint.rs`), ensuring reliable processing of user-uploaded files within the applications architecture. By providing test cases with defined file paths and filenames, developers can validate functionality related to handling various types of files, ensuring a stable and feature-rich user experience. |
